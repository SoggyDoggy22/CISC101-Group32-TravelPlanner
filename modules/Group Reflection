## Group Reflection
Working with the AI critique helped us notice unclear instructions, missing guardrails, and assumptions we didn’t realize we had made in our module. Copilot pointed out places where the prompt could fail with incomplete user inputs, which made us strengthen error-handling and clarify formatting expectations. However, human judgment was essential for deciding which suggestions actually improved usability without over-complicating the module. We kept changes that enhanced clarity and consistency with the system prompt while rejecting ones that altered tone or workflow. This experience showed why modularity and version control matter—small updates become safer, traceable, and easier to test across branches.
