## Group Reflection
Working with the AI critique made it easier for us to identify any assumptions and errors we made, as well as any unclear instructions and missing safeguards. Copilot identified areas where incomplete user input could cause the prompt to fail, so we strengthened error-handling and made formatting expectations clear. But determining which recommendations genuinely enhanced usability without unduly complicating the module required human judgment. Changes that improved clarity and consistency with the system prompt were retained, but those that changed the tone or workflow were rejected. This experience demonstrated the importance of version control and modularity: minor changes become safer, traceable, and simpler to test across branches.
